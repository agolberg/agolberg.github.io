    "text": "The future - Join me!\nPhenomenological structure formation and destruction continuous processes development Traditional continuous processes including extrusion, pulsed electric field, hydrothermal liquefaction and fermentation rely on a complex interplay of factors such as mixed flow, adjustable throughput, head pressure loss, moisture, and temperature. Consequently, the flow path and the type of flow generated inside the specific reactors (extruders, pulsed electric field devices, fermenters or high pressure reactors) remain poorly understood, with undefined boundary conditions. These boundary conditions encompass variables like wall velocity, shear stress distribution, effective strength, elongation flow location, hot spots due to shear heating, slip-stick flow areas, and pressure distribution across the extrusion barrel and distributor. Understanding these boundaries is critical for achieving clear and comprehensible structure and, thus, formation/destruction within the reactors. The process of structurization and texturization is highly dynamic, especially when dealing with highly concentrated suspensions. The transition of structure from a plastic suspension to a viscoelastic food polymer makes it highly responsive to any anisotropic flow field. To address these challenges, we have outlined key research and development objectives aimed at clarifying the texturization and other struction formation/destruction phenomena under well-defined flow conditions (continuous processes)."

    "text": "Electroporation and pulsed electric fields for wound healing\nQuestions identified. Wound healing is a complex phenomenon that is very difficult to control. Nevertheless, control is required to prevent abnormal healing processes such scars or nonhealing wounds. We developed the application of high-voltage, pulsed electric fields in wound healing with particular emphasis on burn wounds. High-voltage, pulsed electric fields lead to the change in the cell membrane permeability, a process coined as electroporation. In the recent decades, electroporation found multiple applications in medicine and biotechnology, yet its application in wound healing has started to emerge recently. The questions we work on deal with electroporation uses in\n\na model for scarless wound healing\nscar reduction following third-degree burns\nskin rejuvenation\nburn wounds disinfection\ngene electrotransfer to treat chronic wounds\n\nMajor results\nWhat is a wound, how does it heal, and how can we prevent scarring? The concept of wound healing has puzzled humans even before the advent of modern medicine.\nIn recent years, bioengineering has tackled the problems of cancer, tissue engineering and molecular manufacturing. The broad spectrum of technologies developed in these fields could potentially transform the wound care practice. However, entering the world of wound healing research is challenging — a broad spectrum of knowledge is required to understand wounds and improve healing.\nThis book provides an essential introduction of the field of wound healing to bioengineers and scientists outside the field of medicine. Written by leading researchers from various fields, this book is a comprehensive primer that gives readers a holistic understanding of the field of wound biology, diagnostics and treatment technologies.\n\n\n\nProducts of the efforts\n\nPatent on Device and process for scar reduction after burn injury\nPatent on System and method for electrical control of bacteria\nPatent on Device and process for skin rejuvenation\nPatent on System and method for stimulating hair growth"
